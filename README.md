## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on accelerating innovation through data-driven modeling and high-throughput experimentation in molecule discovery and formulation design.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Power BI, and large language models (LLMs), as well as Scrum methodologies.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on empirical and molecular modeling projects and fast prototyping for formulation design.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with automation techniques and retrosynthesis analysis for molecule discovery.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about integrating modeling with experimentation and fostering collaborative teamwork.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/xueying-ko/.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her.
